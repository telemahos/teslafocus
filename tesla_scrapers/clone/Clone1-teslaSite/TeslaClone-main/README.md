# Tesla Clone Website

Welcome to the Tesla Clone Website repository! This website was created as a clone of the official Tesla website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features animations created and inspired by JavaScript, and currently only implements the first page of the real website.




## Project Details

The website was developed as part of a personal project to improve my front-end development skills. The main focus of this project was to create animations using JavaScript to replicate the smooth transitions and effects seen on the official Tesla website.

The website consists of a single page that showcases the Tesla Model S, with interactive elements such as a dropdown menu for selecting different vehicle colors and a slider for adjusting the price range.
